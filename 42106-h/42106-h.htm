<h2><a name="HOW_TO_FENCE" id="HOW_TO_FENCE">HOW TO FENCE.</a></h2>


<p>Fencing is the art of using the small-sword, or
rapier. The small-sword has a straight blade,
about thirty-two inches in length outside the guard,
and is fashioned for <i>thrusting</i> only. Although it
is an art of the greatest antiquity, very great improvements
have been made in it during the last
half-century, chiefly by French masters, who excel
those of all other countries. This has been attributed
to various causes; by some to the agility
and acknowledged power of rapid physical action
possessed by this nation; by others, to their natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
vivacity and mental quickness. In my opinion,
however, a more direct and powerful cause may be
traced in the great encouragement and universal
patronage which it has ever received from every
grade of a chivalrous and military people. Every
regiment has its <i>maitre d'armes</i>, and every barrack
its fencing-school. Indeed, in so important a
light was the proper teaching of this art held, that
one of the French kings (Louis XIV.) granted letters-patent
to twenty eminent masters, who alone
were permitted to teach in Paris. When a vacancy
occurred, no interest and no favor could enable a
candidate to obtain this privilege: he had to fence
in public with six of these chosen masters, and if
by any of them he was beaten by two distinct hits,
he was considered unqualified to teach in the capital.</p>

<p>Independent of its value as the scientific use of
the sword&mdash;the gentleman's weapon of defense,
<i>par excellence</i>&mdash;fencing stands unrivaled as an
<i>exercise</i>; and it is in this sense that it will now be
treated. The most eminent physicians which this
country have produced, have all, in the most
earnest manner, recommended it to the attention
of the young. Thus, Dr. Clive says:</p>

<p>"Muscular exertion is essential in perfecting
the form of the body, and those exercises which
require the exercise of the greatest number of
muscles are the most conducive to this end.
Fencing causes more muscles to act at the same
time than most other exercises. It promotes the
expansion of the chest, and improves respiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
whereby the functions of the most important
organs of the body are more perfectly performed."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony Carlisle uses similar language:</p>

<p>"According to my judgment, the exercise of
fencing tends to promote bodily health, and the development
of athletic powers. It is likewise apparent
that the attitudes and exertions of fencing
are conducive to the manly forms and muscular
energies of the human figure."</p>

<p>Again, Sir Everard Home, in still stronger
terms:</p>

<p>"Of all the different modes in which the body
can be exercised, there is none, in my judgment,
that is capable of giving strength and velocity, as
well as precision, to the action of all the voluntary
muscles of the body in an equal degree as the practice
of fencing, and none more conducive to bodily
health."</p>

<p>I shall give one more extract from another physician
of equal eminence, Dr. Babbington:</p>

<p>"I am of opinion that, in addition to the amusement
which this exercise (fencing) affords, it is
particularly calculated to excite in young persons a
greater degree of energy and circumspection than
they might otherwise possess; and it is obvious
that, in respect of health, that mode of exertion is
<i>superior to all others</i>, which, while it gives motion
and activity to every part of the body, produces
at the same time corresponding interest in
the mind."</p>

<p>Sir John Sinclair, Dr. Pemberton, &amp;c., speak in
terms equally recommendatory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>To avoid all danger in the lessons and practice,
foils are substituted for real swords. Strong wire
masks are worn on the face, a well-padded glove
on the hand; and the upper part of the body, at
which alone the thrusts are aimed, is protected by
a strong jacket, the right side and collar of which
should be of leather.</p>

<p>The first movement a beginner has to learn, is
the manner of placing himself in the position
called</p>


<h3>THE GUARD.</h3>

<p>It is from this position that all movements are
made, whether offensive or defensive. Let the beginner
be placed with his knees straight, his feet
at right angles, heel to heel; the right foot, right
side, and face directed to the master. The body
must be held upright and firm, the arms hanging
down by the side, but easily and without constraint,
the left hand holding the foil a few inches
beneath its guard. Next, let him bring the right
hand across the body, and seize the foil-handle; by
a second movement, bring the foil above the head,
the hands separating as they ascend, until both
arms be nearly extended upwards and outwards.
Here pause. This may be called the <i>first position</i>
of the Guard.</p>

<p>These movements should be frequently practiced,
as they accustom the arms to move independently
of the body, flatten the joints of the shoulders, and
give prominence to the chest.</p>

<p>To arrive at the <i>second position</i> of the Guard,
the right arm, with the foil, is brought down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
front, until the right elbow is a little above and in
advance of the waist; the fore-arm and foil sloping
upwards; the point of the foil being the height of
the upper part of the face; then, by a second movement,
the learner must sink down, separating the
knees, and stepping forward with the right foot
fourteen or sixteen inches; for, of course, the guard
of a tall man will be wider than that of a short
one. However, his own comfort in the position
will direct him as to the distance; and the general
rule is, that the knee of the left leg will jut over
the toes of the left foot, and the right leg from ankle
to knee be perpendicular. It is in this position
that he will receive all attacks from an adversary,
and from this position will all his own attacks be
made. Also in this position will he</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i02large.jpg"><img src="images/i02.jpg" width="400" height="332" alt="" /></a>
</div>


<h3>ADVANCE</h3>

<p>upon an adversary, when beyond hitting distance.
The step in the advance is usually about that of the
width of the Guard, although of course this would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
vary with circumstances. The step is made by
advancing the right foot the distance I have
named; and on its reaching the ground, the left
foot is brought up, and takes its place. To</p>


<h3>RETREAT,</h3>

<p>the reverse of the above movement is made.
The left foot takes the lead, stepping to the rear
about as far as the right had stepped to the front;
the right occupying its place on its taking up its
new position. The next movement,</p>


<h3>THE LONGE,</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i03large.jpg"><img src="images/i03.jpg" width="400" height="254" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>is a very important movement, and is rather difficult
to make properly, and fatiguing to practice.
Indeed, the first movements in fencing are the
most trying to the learner; and he must not be
discouraged if he fails to do them correctly at
first&mdash;practice only will give him this power. The
Longe is that extension of body which accompanies
every attack, and is thus made:&mdash;The right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
arm is extended straight from the shoulder, the
arm and blade being on the same level; by a second
movement, the right foot is raised from the
ground, and a step made forward, about eighteen
inches in length, while the left remains firmly
planted in its place. At the instant that this step
is made, the left hand is allowed to fall within a
few inches of the left thigh, and the left knee is
stiffened back until the leg is perfectly straight.</p>

<p>The thigh of the right leg will now be in a position
nearly horizontal; from the knee downwards
perpendicular. Having executed the Longe, the
next movement to be made is</p>


<h3>THE RECOVER;</h3>

<p>that is, to return from the position of the Longe to
that of the Guard, and is thus effected:&mdash;The left
arm is nimbly thrown up to its place, the right
arm drawn in, and the left knee re-bent. These
movements must be made at the same time, as it
is their <i>united</i> action that enables a person to recover
from so extended a position as the Longe
quick enough to avoid a thrust if his own attack
has failed.</p>

<p>These movements must be frequently practiced
before any others are attempted&mdash;the Guard, the
Advance, the Retreat, the Longe, and the Recover;
and when the learner has attained some proficiency
in them, he may begin the more delicate movements
of attack and defense. Of these I will now
speak.</p>


<h3>THE ENGAGE.</h3>

<p>It is customary for adversaries, on coming to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the Guard, to <i>Engage</i>, or to join blades, on what
is called the <i>inside</i>, that is, the <i>right</i> side; although
there are occasions on which it is advisable
to engage on the <i>outside</i>, or on the left; otherwise
called the <i>Quarte</i> or <i>Tierce</i> sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i04large.jpg"><img src="images/i04.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Two men thus opposed to each other will at once
perceive that there are two lines of attack open to
them, <i>i. e.</i> the line inside and the line outside the
blade&mdash;these, and no more. But these may be,
and in fencing are, subdivided into inside above
the hand, and inside under the hand, and the same
subdivision for outside. This gives four lines of
attack&mdash;or, to speak more simply, gives four openings
through which an adversary may be assailed.
Now, to protect each of these assailable points,
are four defensive movements, called</p>


<h3>PARADES.</h3>

<p>Each opening has its own parade or defense, and
each parade will guard its own opening, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
strictly speaking, no other. The opening inside
above the hand is defended by two parades.</p>

<p>As its name imports, the first and most natural
parade is that of <i>Prime</i>. The action of drawing
the sword from its sheath is almost exactly the
movement made use of in the parade of Prime.</p>

<p>In this parade the hand is raised as high as the
forehead, so that the fencer can see his opponent's
face under his wrist. The blade of the foil is
almost horizontal, but the point is rather lowered
towards the ground. As this parade will throw
the right side of the body open to the adversary's
sword, it is good play to disengage from left to
right, and deliver a rapid thrust at the adversary,
in order to anticipate him before he can bring his
own sword round for another thrust. His point
will be thrown far out of line, so that he is behind-hand
in point of time.</p>

<p>This is a very useful parade for fencers of short
stature, as they can sometimes get in their blade
under their adversary's arm, after they have parried
his thrust.</p>

<p>The other parade is that of</p>


<h3>QUARTE.</h3>

<p>It is thus formed. On the approach of the point
of an adversary's blade (and how these approaches
are made I will presently explain), the right hand
is moved a few inches&mdash;three or four will be
enough&mdash;across the body on the inside, the hand
being neither depressed nor raised, and the foil
being kept on the same slope as in the Guard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
This guards the body on the inside above the hand,
but (and here comes an important law in fencing)
the very movement which has guarded the body
on one side has exposed it on the other; this is the
case with all the simple parades.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i05large.jpg"><img src="images/i05.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i06large.jpg"><img src="images/i06.jpg" width="400" height="252" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Suppose, now, that the exposed part <i>outside
above</i> the hand were assailed, then the defense for
it is the parade of</p>


<h3>TIERCE.</h3>

<p>It is formed by turning the hand with the nails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
downwards, and crossing to the opposite side some
six or eight inches, the hand and point at the same
elevation as before; this will guard this opening.
If, however, the attack has been made <i>under</i> instead
of over the hand, then the proper parade would
have been <i>seconde</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i07large.jpg"><img src="images/i07.jpg" width="400" height="242" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i08large.jpg"><img src="images/i08.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>There is another method of parade called <i>quarte</i>
over the arm&mdash;which is executed by making about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the same parade as in Tierce, with this exception&mdash;first,
the hand is retained in its original position,
with the nails upwards, and secondly, the point is
not raised over the eye of the adversary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i09large.jpg"><img src="images/i09.jpg" width="400" height="252" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It is rather more delicate than Tierce, but wants
its power and energy. The ripostes, or reply
thrusts, are made as they would have been had the
parade been that of Tierce.</p>


<h3>SECONDE</h3>

<p>is formed by turning the hand in the same position
in which it was turned for tierce, but the point of
the foil slopes as much downwards as in tierce it
did upwards; the direction and distance for the
hand to traverse being the same. Again, had the
attack been delivered at none of these, but at the
<i>inside under</i> the hand, then the proper parade
would have been</p>


<h3>DEMI-CERCLE,</h3>

<p>which, as its name expresses, is a half-circle, described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
by a sweep of the blade traversing the
<i>under</i> line. Next comes the parade of</p>


<h3>OCTAVE.</h3>

<p>In this parade the hand is held as in Quarte; the
hilt of the foil is kept lower than that of the opponent:
the blade is almost horizontal, the point being
only slightly lower than the hilt, and directed
towards the body of the adversary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i10large.jpg"><img src="images/i10.jpg" width="400" height="243" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Octave is extremely useful when the fencer
misses his parade of Demi-cercle, as there is but a
short distance for the point to traverse, and it generally
meets the blade of the adversary before the
point can be properly fixed. Moreover, it brings
the point so near the adversary's body, that he will
not venture to make another thrust until he has removed
the foil.</p>

<p>Thus I have enumerated, and partly explained,
the forms and uses of these four parades: they are
called Simple Parades, to distinguish them from another
set of defensive movements, called</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>


<h3>CONTRE-PARADES.</h3>

<p>I have said and shown that a man standing foil
in hand, in the position of the guard, is exposed in
four distinct places to thrusts from an adversary
within longeing distance. I have also shown that
he has a defense for each of these exposed places;
but if a man has but <i>one</i> defense for each assailable
part, then his adversary, knowing beforehand
what the defense must be, would be prepared beforehand
to deceive him. But if he has a reserve&mdash;if
he has a <i>second</i> defense for each part&mdash;then
the adversary cannot tell what the defense will be,
until his attack, false or real, is begun.</p>

<p>To meet this contingency, a second series of defenses
have been devised, which are of an entirely
different nature from the <i>Simple</i> Parades.</p>

<p>Again, as each of the simple parades is framed
to guard only one opening, it was found desirable
that the contre-parades should be of a more comprehensive
character. They are therefore devised
so that each is capable of protecting the entire
front. It is evident that this object could not be
attained without the sacrifice of quickness, because
a larger space must be traversed, and therefore
more time is occupied with a contre than a simple
parade.</p>

<p>To know one contre-parade is virtually to know
all, as they are all formed on the same plan. They
are all full circles in the position of hand and
direction of foil of the different simple parades; or
more clearly speaking, each simple parade has a
contre-parade; there are, therefore, four simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and four contre-parades, which may be thus
arranged:</p>

<table summary="parades / contre-parades">
<tr><td>Quarte</td><td>Contre de Quarte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tierce</td><td>Contre de Tierce.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Seconde</td><td>Contre de Seconde.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Demi-cercle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Contre de Cercle.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>I have said that a contre-parade is a full circle
in the position of hand and direction of blade of
its simple; thus, contre de quarte is made by retaining
the hand in the position of quarte, while
the foil describes a circle descending on the inside,
and returning by the outside to the place of its
departure. So with all the others, the foil <i>following
the direction of the simple</i> parade, of which it
is the contre. These complete the entire system
of defenses.</p>

<p>I now come to the movements of an opposite
nature, namely, the</p>


<h3>ATTACKS,</h3>

<p>and shall begin with the most simple of them. I
will again suppose two adversaries standing <i>en
guard</i>, within longeing distance of each other: now
the most simple movement that the attacking
party could make would be</p>


<h3>THE STRAIGHT THRUST</h3>

<p>to the outside or inside, according to his line of
engagement. I have, in describing the longe, in
effect described the straight thrust; it is but a
longe in a straight line, taking care, however, to
feel firmly the adversary's blade, but taking care
also not to press or lean on it during the delivering
of the thrust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Next in character comes</p>


<h3>THE DISENGAGEMENT.</h3>

<p>This attack is made by dropping the point of the
foil beneath the adversary's blade, and raising it
on the opposite side, at the same time, rising with
the arm fully extended; on the completion of the
extension the longe is made and the thrust delivered.</p>


<h3>THE ONE-TWO</h3>

<p>is but a double disengagement, the first being but
a feint or false attack, to induce the adversary to
form a parade to cover the part threatened, for the
covering of one part of the body exposes the opposite;
the second disengagement is made to take
advantage of this exposure. The arm is extended
half-way on the first, and then wholly on the second,
to be immediately followed by the longe.</p>


<h3>THE BEAT AND THRUST.</h3>

<p>This is another variety of attack. Supposing
the adversary's blade to be firmly joined to yours,
when you wished to deliver a <i>straight thrust</i>, there
would then be danger of your falling upon his
point. This danger is avoided by giving a slight
beat on his blade the instant preceding your extension
of arm, of course to be followed <i>en suite</i> by
the longe.</p>

<p>The companion attack to this one is</p>


<h3>THE BEAT AND DISENGAGEMENT.</h3>

<p>The <i>beat</i> here takes the character of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
disengagement in <i>one-two</i>, <i>i. e.</i> becomes a <i>feint</i>,
and is intended to induce the adversary to return
to the place he occupied when the beat was made.
You then immediately pass to the opposite side of
his blade in the manner described in the <i>disengagement</i>.</p>

<p>It will be seen that all these movements pass
<i>under</i> the adversary's blade. However, there are
certain situations in the <i>assault</i>, as a fencing about
is called, when an adversary is more assailable
<i>over the point</i> than under the blade; for this purpose
there is what the French call the <i>coupe sur
peint</i>, or</p>


<h3>CUT OVER THE POINT.</h3>

<p>It is thus made:&mdash;By the action of the hand, and
without drawing it back at all, the foil is raised
and brought down on the opposite side of the adversary's
blade, the arm being extended during
its fall to the horizontal position, on attaining
which the longe is delivered.</p>


<h3>CUT OVER AND DISENGAGEMENT</h3>

<p>is on the same principal as the <i>one-two</i> and the
<i>beat and disengagement</i>. On the adversary opposing
the first movement (the cut) with a parade,
the second movement (the disengagement) is made
to the opposite side, to be followed, of course, by
the longe, the extension of the arm being divided
between the two movements.</p>

<p>These attacks are called simple attacks, because
they may be parried by one or more simple parades,
according to the number of movements in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
attack. In fact, every attack can be parried, and
every parade can be deceived; it is the <i>additional</i>
movement last made which hits or guards.</p>

<p>Thus, you threaten by a disengagement to the
outside; your adversary bars your way effectually
by the parade of <i>tierce</i>; you make a second disengagement
to the inside, which is now exposed from
the very fact of the outside being guarded (for both
lines of attack cannot be guarded at the same time),
thus converting your attack into <i>one-two</i>; but if
your adversary parries quarte on your <i>second</i> movement,
your attack would be warded off. This can
be carried much further, but the above will, I think,
be sufficient to explain the nature of simple parades
and attacks.</p>

<p>To deceive a <i>contre</i>-parade, a separate movement,
called a</p>


<h3>DOUBLE,</h3>

<p>has been invented; it is very simple in principle, and
admirably answers the purpose. For instance if
you were to threaten your adversary by a disengagement
to the outside, and if, instead of tierce,
he parried <i>contra de quarte</i>, the double is then
made by your making a <i>second</i> disengagement <i>to
the same side as the first</i>, for it will be found that
his <i>contra de quarte</i> has replaced the blade in the
positions they occupied previous to your disengagement.
You will then have an opening, and may
finish the attack by the longe.</p>

<p>As all the contra-parades are on the same plan
and principle, so are all the doubles. Of course, it
is understood that you will make all the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of the double <i>en suite</i>, and without allowing
your adversary's blade to overtake yours.</p>


<h3>ALL FEINTS.</h3>

<p>The foregoing movements having been well practiced
in the lesson, the next step is that of <i>all feints</i>
and <i>all parades</i>, and may be practiced either with
a master or fellow-pupil. The practice consists of
one pupil standing on the defensive <i>entirely</i>, while
another assumes the offensive, and attacks him
with <i>all</i> the <i>feints</i> of which he is master, the other,
of course, defending with all his parades. It is
excellent practice, as it accustoms the pupil to
think for himself gradually, he having thus but one
set of movements to think about. He is therefore
enabled to make them boldly, without having to
encounter unknown movements from his adversary.</p>

<p>It also enables him to see the extent of his resources,
both for attack and defense. When he
can both attack and defend with some presence of
mind, he may then begin</p>


<h3>THE ASSAULT;</h3>

<p>that is, he may encounter an adversary, to attack
or defend as occasion presents. He is then left to
his own resources entirely. The following</p>


<h3>GENERAL ADVICE,</h3>

<p>given by a very eminent fencer and excellent
teacher, cannot fail to be of use:</p>

<p>"Do not put yourself on the position of the guard
within the reach of your adversary's thrusts, especially
at the time of drawing your sword.</p>

<p>"If you are much inferior, make no long assaults.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do nothing that is useless; every movement
should tend to your advantage.</p>

<p>"Let your movements be made as much within
the line of your adversary's body as possible.</p>

<p>"Endeavor both to discover your adversary's
designs and to conceal your own.</p>

<p>"Two skillful men, acting together, fight more
with their heads than their hands.</p>

<p>"The smaller you can make the movements with
your foil, the quicker will your point arrive at your
adversary's body.</p>

<p>"Do not endeavor to give many thrusts on the
longe, thus running the risk of receiving one in the
interim.</p>

<p>"If your adversary drops his foil by accident, or
in consequence of a smart parade of yours, you
should immediately pick it up, and present it to
him politely.</p>

<p>"Always join blades (if possible) previously to
another attack, after a hit is given."</p>

<h2><a name="BROADSWORD_EXERCISE" id="BROADSWORD_EXERCISE">BROADSWORD EXERCISE.</a></h2>


<p>The principal distinction between the broadsword
and the rapier is, that the latter is formed
only for thrusting, while the former is adapted for
cutting also. Indeed, those who use the broadsword
are, in my opinion, too apt to neglect the
use of the point, and to give their attention almost
exclusively to the cuts.</p>

<p>The first lesson in the sword exercise is necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to know how to stand. The learner should
be instructed to perform the different movements
by word of command, remembering to consider the
first parts of the word as a caution, and not to stir
until the <i>last</i> syllable is uttered. At the last syllable,
the movement should be performed smartly.
In giving the word, the instructor always makes a
slight pause, in order to give his pupils time to
remember what they must do. For example, the
words Draw Swords is given thus, Draw ...
Swords&mdash;the word swords being spoken smartly, in
order that the movement may correspond.</p>


<h3>POSITIONS.</h3>

<p>First Position.&mdash;Make the target <span class="footnote">
[For target, see <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a>.]</span> about fourteen
inches in diameter, and place it on the wall, having
its center about four feet from the ground. Draw
a perpendicular line from the spot at the bottom of
the target to the ground, and continue it on the
floor, in order to insure the proper position of the
heels. The learner stands perfectly upright opposite
the target, with his right side towards it, his
heels close together, his right toe pointing to the
target, and his left foot at right angles with the
left. His arms must be clasped behind his back,
his right palm supporting the left elbow, and his
left hand grasping the right arm just above the
elbow. In this position, he must bend both knees
and sink down as far as possible. This will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
very far at first, but he will soon sink down quite
easily.</p>

<p>Second Position.&mdash;This is accomplished by
placing the right foot smartly in front, about sixteen
or fourteen inches before the left. (See fig. 1.)
He must accustom himself to balance himself so
perfectly on his left foot that he can place the right
either before or behind it, without losing his balance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 298px;">
<a href="images/i11large.jpg"><img src="images/i11.jpg" width="298" height="456" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Fig. 1.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Third Position.&mdash;The third position must then
be learned. This consists of stepping well forward
with the right foot, until the left knee is
quite straight, and the right knee exactly perpendicularly
placed over the right foot. Great care
must be taken to keep the heels exactly in the
same line and the body perfectly upright. (See
fig. 2.)</p>

<p>These preliminaries having been settled, the
learner stands upright before the target. A sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
is then put into his hand, and the target is explained
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i12large.jpg"><img src="images/i12.jpg" width="400" height="456" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Fig. 2.</i></span>
</div>


<h3>TARGET.</h3>

<p>The interior lines represent the cuts. Cut one
being directed from No. 1 diagonally through the
target, coming out at 4. Cut two is the same,
only from left to right. Three is made upwards
diagonally, and four is the same, only in the opposite
direction. Cut five is horizontally through
the target from right to left, and six from left to
right. Cut seven is perpendicularly downwards.
Care must be taken that the cuts are fairly given
with the edge.</p>

<p>The swords drawn on the target represent the
guards. The seventh guard ought, however, not
to be made directly across, but must have the
point directly rather forwards and downwards, as
a cut 7 glides off the blade, and can be instantly
answered either by a thrust or by cut 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The two dark circles represent the places where
the thrusts take effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i13large.jpg"><img src="images/i13.jpg" width="400" height="349" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The learner begins by taking the sword in his
right hand, having its edge toward the target and
its back resting on his shoulder. His right arm is
bent at right angles, and the elbow against his
side. The left hand must rest upon the hip, the
thumb being to the rear. At the word&mdash;</p>


<h3>CUTS AND GUARDS.</h3>


<h3>CUTS.</h3>

<p><i>Cut</i> 1.&mdash;The young swordsman extends his right
arm, and makes the cut clear through the target.
When the point has cleared the target, continue
the sweep of the sword, and by the turn of the
wrist bring it with its back on the left shoulder, its
edge towards the left. The arm is then ready for</p>

<p><i>Cut</i> 2.&mdash;Bring the sword from 2 to 3, continue
the movement of the sword, and turn the wrist so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
that the point is below the right hip and the edge
towards the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 246px;">
<a href="images/i14large.jpg"><img src="images/i14.jpg" width="246" height="456" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><i>Cut</i> 3.&mdash;Cut through the target diagonally,
bringing the sword from No. 3 to No. 2, and bring
the sword onwards, so that it rests with the edge
downwards, and point below the left hip. At</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;">
<a href="images/i15large.jpg"><img src="images/i15.jpg" width="299" height="456" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>First Point.</i></span>
</div>

<p><i>Cut</i> 4.&mdash;Cut from 4 to 1, and bring the sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
round until its point is over the right shoulder, and
its edge well to the right.</p>

<p><i>Cut</i> 5.&mdash;At the word Five, make a horizontal
cut from 5 to 6, and sweep the sword round until it
rests on the left shoulder, with its edge to the left,
and its point well over the shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Cut</i> 6.&mdash;Cut horizontally through the target from
6 to 5, and bring the sword over the head with the
edge upwards, and its point hanging over the back.
From this position,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cut</i> 7.&mdash;Make a downward stroke until the sword
reaches the center of the target. Arrest it there,
and remain with the arm extended, waiting for the
word.</p>


<h3>POINTS.</h3>

<p>First Point.&mdash;Draw back the sword, until the
right wrist is against the right temple, the edge of
the sword being upwards. Make a slight pause,
and then thrust smartly forward toward the center
of the target, raising the right wrist as high as
No. 1, and pressing the left shoulder well back.</p>

<p>Second Point.&mdash;Turn the wrist round to the left,
so that the edge comes upwards, draw the hand
back until it rests on the breast, and give the point
forwards, to the center of the target, raising the
hand as before.</p>

<p>Third Point.&mdash;Give the handle of the sword a
slight twist in the hand to the right, so that the
edge again comes uppermost, and the guard rests
against the back of the hand. Draw back the hand
until it rests against the right hip, and deliver it
forward towards the spot at the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
target, raising the wrist as high as the spot in the
center. The object in raising the wrist is to deceive
the eye of the opponent, who will be more
likely to notice the position of your wrist than of
your point. In all the thrusts, the left shoulder
should be rather brought forward before the point
is given, and pressed well back while it is being
delivered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<a href="images/i16large.jpg"><img src="images/i16.jpg" width="345" height="456" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Second Point.</i></span>
</div>


<h3>GUARDS.</h3>

<p>Wait after the third point has been delivered for
the word,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Defend.</span>&mdash;At this word draw up the hand
smartly, and form the first guard. Make the other
guards in succession as they are named, while the
instructor proves their accuracy by giving the corresponding
cuts. The guards must be learned
from the target, by placing the sword in exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the same position as those delineated. The guards
are these:</p>

<tr><td>A First guard.</td><td>E Fifth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>B Second.</td><td>F Sixth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>C Third.</td><td>G Seventh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>D Fourth.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The two spots H and I mark the places towards
which the points are made, H for the first and second
point, I for the third.</p>


<h3>PARRY.</h3>

<p>The parry or parade of a thrust is executed with
the back of the sword. The firmest way of parrying
is to hold the sword perpendicular, with its
edge to the right and its hilt about the height of
and close to the right shoulder; then, by sweeping
the sword round from left to right, any thrust
within its sweep is thrown wide of the body.</p>

<p>The parry is executed with the wrist, and not
with the arm, which must not move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>


<h3>HANGING GUARD.</h3>

<p>When the pupil is acquainted with both cuts
and guards, he should learn the hanging guard, a
most useful position, as it keeps the body well
hidden under the sword, and at the same time
leaves the sword in a good position to strike or
thrust.</p>

<p>It is accomplished in the following way:&mdash;Step
out to the second position, raise the arm until the
hand is just over the right foot, and as high as the
head. The edge of the sword is upwards, and the
point is directed downwards and towards the left.
The left shoulder is pressed rather forward, and the
neck and chest drawn inward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i18large.jpg"><img src="images/i18.jpg" width="400" height="411" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>In this position, the swordsman is in a position
to receive or make an attack as he may think fit.
It is rather fatiguing at first, owing to the unaccustomed
position of the arm and head, but the
fatigue is soon overcome, and then it will be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that there is no attitude which gives equal advantages.</p>

<p>There are two other modes of standing on guard,
each possessing their peculiar advantages. These
are, the inside and outside guard. The inside
guard is made as follows:</p>


<h3>INSIDE GUARD.</h3>

<p>Stand in the second position, having the wrist
of the right hand nearly as low as the waist, the
hand being exactly over the right foot. The point
of the sword is raised as high as the eyes, and the
edge is turned inwards.</p>


<h3>OUTSIDE GUARD.</h3>

<p>The outside guard is formed in the same manner
as the inside, with the exception that the edge of
the sword is turned well outwards.</p>

<p>To get to the hanging guard, the words are
given as follows:&mdash;Inside guard&mdash;outside guard&mdash;guard.</p>


<h3>ATTACK AND DEFENSE.</h3>

<p>The swordsman having learned thus far, is
taught to combine the three movements of striking,
thrusting, and guarding, by the following exercise:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Inside Guard.</p>

<p>2. Outside Guard.</p>

<p>3. Guard.</p>

<p>4. Cut One.</p>

<p>5. First Guard.</p>

<p>6. Cut Two.</p>

<p>7. Second Guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>8. Cut Three.</p>

<p>9. Third Guard.</p>

<p>10. Cut Four.</p>

<p>11. Fourth Guard.</p>

<p>12. Cut Five.</p>

<p>13. Fifth Guard.</p>

<p>14. Cut Six.</p>

<p>15. Sixth Guard.</p>

<p>16. Cut Seven.</p>

<p>17. Seventh Guard.</p>

<p>18. First Point. [Prepare for the point in
First Position.] Two. [Thrust in Third Position.]</p>

<p>19. Second Point. [Prepare for it in First Position.]
Two. [Thrust in Third Position.]</p>

<p>20. Third Point. [Prepare.] Two. [Thrust.]</p>

<p>21. Parry. [Prepare to parry in First Position.]
Two. [Parry.]</p>

<p>22. Guard.</p>

<p>The young swordsman must remember that in
this, as in all the exercises, the cuts and points
must be given in the third position, as in the accompanying
illustration, which shows the swordsman
just as he has delivered the seventh cut, and
is waiting for the next word before he resumes the
first position.</p>

<p>The guards, on the contrary, are given in the
first position, as is seen in the figure on <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>, which
illustrates the seventh guard.</p>

<p>These exercises are always learned with the
single-stick, or basket-hilted cudgel, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
avoid the dangers which would be inevitable if the
sword were used. But as the single-stick is only
an imitation of the sword, I will give the method
of getting the sword out of the sheath into any
position required.</p>


<h3>DRAW SWORDS.</h3>

<p>The first word of command is <i>draw swords</i>. At
the word <i>draw</i>, seize the sheath just below the
hilt, with the left hand, and raise the hilt as high
as the hip, at the same time grasping the hilt with
the right hand, turning the edge of the sword to
the rear, and drawing it partially from the sheath,
to insure its easy removal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i19large.jpg"><img src="images/i19.jpg" width="400" height="265" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Seventh Cut.</i></span>
</div>

<p>At the word <i>swords</i>, draw the blade smartly out
of the scabbard, throwing the point upwards, at
the full extent of the arm, the edge being still to the
rear.</p>


<h3>RECOVER SWORDS.</h3>

<p>The wrist is now smartly lowered until it is level
with the chin, the blade upright, and the edge to
the left. This is the position of recover swords.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
The elbow must be kept close to the body as in the
cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i20large.jpg"><img src="images/i20.jpg" width="400" height="587" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Seventh Guard.</i></span>
</div>


<h3>CARRY SWORDS.</h3>

<p>The wrist is now sharply lowered until the arm
hangs at its full length, the wrist being in the line
with the hip, the edge of the sword to the front,
and its back resting in the hollow of the shoulder,
the fingers lightly holding the hilt. The left hand
hangs at the side until the word <i>inside guard</i>,
when it is placed on the left hip.</p>


<h3>SLOPE SWORDS.</h3>

<p>At the word <i>swords</i>, raise the right hand smartly,
until it forms a right angle at the elbow.</p>


<h3>RETURN SWORDS.</h3>

<p>At the word, raise the blade until it is perpendicular,
move the hilt to the hollow of the left
shoulder, drop the point of the sword into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
scabbard (which has been grasped by the left hand
and slightly raised), at the same time turning the
edge to the rear. Pause an instant, and send the
sword smartly into the sheath, removing both
hands as the hilt strikes against the mouth of the
scabbard; drop them to the side, with the palms
outwards, and in the first position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
<a href="images/i21large.jpg"><img src="images/i21.jpg" width="320" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><i>Recover Swords.</i></span>
</div>


<h3>PRACTICES.</h3>

<p>There are many exercises with the broadsword,
called <i>practices</i>. I have given one of them, which
is to be practiced alone; but when the pupil has
attained some confidence in the use of his weapon,
he must be placed opposite another pupil, and they
must go through them, each taking the attack and
defense in turn.</p>

<p>The young swordsman must be provided with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
very stout wire mask, which defends the face and
part of the neck, and which should be worked in a
kind of helmet above, to guard against the disastrous
consequences of receiving the seventh guard.
No practices, loose or otherwise, should be permitted
without the masks, as neither party would
be able to cut or thrust with proper confidence.</p>


<h3>SECOND PRACTICE.</h3>

<p>This is very useful in teaching the point and
parry, as well as giving steadiness on the feet.
Two boys are placed opposite each other, at just
such a distance, that when perfectly erect they can
touch the hilt of their adversary's sword with the
point of their own.</p>

<p>The one who gives the first point is called Front
Rank (there may be a dozen in each rank, each
having tried the distance to his right by extending
his sword), and the one who gives first parry is
called Rear Rank.</p>

<table summary="Second Practice" class="practice">
<tr><th>Word of<br />Command.</th><th colspan="3">Front Rank.</th><th>Rear Rank.</th></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Point, &amp;c. &amp;c.</td></tr></table>

<p>This should be continued until both are weary.</p>

<p>Both swordsmen should learn to do it more rapidly
every time they practice. Next time of going
through it, front rank and rear rank change places,
as they must do in all the practices.</p>

<p>In this and the other practices the cuts must be
delivered in the third position, and the guards in
the first. In the third and fourth practices the
cuts must be given lightly, as many of them are
not intended to be guarded, but merely to show the
powers of the sword in various positions.</p>

<p>In this and the preceding exercise, the power of
shifting the leg is shown. If two swordsmen attack
each other, and No. 1 strikes at the leg of No. 2,
it will be better for No. 2 not to oppose the cut by
the third or fourth guard, but to draw back the
leg smartly, and cut six or seven at the adversary's
head or neck.</p>

<p>In loose play, as it is called, <i>i. e.</i>, when two
parties engage with swords without following any
word of command, but strike and guard as they
can, both players stand in the second position, because
they can either advance or retreat as they
choose, and can longe out to the third position for
a thrust or a cut, or spring up to the first position
for a guard with equal ease.</p>

<p>It is often a kind of trap, to put the right leg
more forward than usual, in order to induce the
adversary to make a cut at it. When he does so,
the leg is drawn back, the stroke passes harmless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and the deceived striker gets the stick of his
opponent on his head or shoulders.</p>

<p>This practice is capital exercise, and looks very
imposing. All these practices ought to be so familiar
that the words of command are not needed,
the only word required being First, Second, or
Third practices, as the case may be.</p>

<p>I can remember once, that two of my pupils had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
attained such a mastery of their weapons that we
used often to go through the practice with real
swords. On one occasion, we were acting a
charade, and my eldest pupil and myself were
enacting the part of two distinguished foreigners
(country unknown) who were to get up a fight. So
we began by a little quarrel, and finally drew our
swords and set hard to work at the fifth practice,
which we could do with extreme rapidity, and
without the use of words of command. The spectators
were horrified, and the ladies greatly
alarmed; for there seems to be no particular order
in that practice, and an inexperienced eye would
certainly fancy that the combatants were in
earnest.</p>


<h3>FORT AND FEEBLE.</h3>

<p>The half of the sword-blade next the hilt is called
the "fort," because it is the strongest place on
which the cut of an adversary can be received.
Always parry and guard with the fort of your
sword, as, if you try to guard a cut with the
"feeble," which is the remaining half of the blade,
your guard will be forced, and the cut take effect.</p>


<h3>DRAWING CUT.</h3>

<p>The drawing cut is made best with a curved
sword, and is executed by placing the edge of the
sword on the object, and drawing it over it until
it is severed. A good large mangel-wurzel is capital
practice. Place the root loose on a table,
stand at arm's-length from it, lay the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sword lightly on it, and slice the root by repeatedly
drawing the sword over it. This is very difficult,
although it looks easy enough, and is sure
to jar the arm from the wrist to the shoulder the
first time or two, while the sword glides off as if
the root were cased in polished steel. However,
a little practice will soon overcome the difficulty.
This cut is much in use among the Sikhs.</p>


<h3>GENERAL ADVICE.</h3>

<p>Never look at your own sword, but watch the
eye and sword-wrist of your opponent.</p>

<p>Remember that the great point in this exercise,
as in fencing, is to gain time. Endeavor, therefore,
to advance your point nearer your adversary
than his is to you.</p>

<p>Begin the assault out of distance, so that neither
party can complain of being taken by surprise.</p>

<p>If the two parties exchange a cut or a thrust at
the same moment, the one who gave his cut or
thrust in the third position is victorious.</p>

<p>When a cut or thrust is made, the one who receives
it passes his sword, <i>i. e.</i>, stick, into his left
hand, and his opponent comes to inside guard.</p>

<p>Always spring back to the second position after
delivering a cut or thrust.</p>

<p>Keep the line of direction carefully, or you will
leave an open space for the adversary to get his
sword into.</p>

<p>Last and most important,&mdash;Don't lose your temper!</p>

<h2><a name="ARCHERY" id="ARCHERY">ARCHERY.</a></h2>


<h3>IMPLEMENTS OF THE CRAFT.</h3>

<p>For the Purposes of the Archer the following
implements are required, which may be obtained
at any of the principal makers in New York or
Boston&mdash;first, the bow; secondly, the arrow;
thirdly, a quiver, pouch, and belt; fourthly, a
tassel and grease-pot; fifthly, an arm-guard or
brace, and a shooting glove; sixthly, a target or
targets; and seventhly, a scoring card.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bow</span> is the most important article in archery,
and also the most expensive. It is usually
from five to six feet in length, made of a single
piece of yew, or of lancewood and hickory glued
together back to back. The former suits gentlemen
the best, and the latter being more lively is
better adapted for the short, sharp pull of the
ladies. The wood is gradually tapered, and at
each end is a tip of horn, the one from the upper
end being longer than the other or lower one.
The strength of bows is marked in pounds, varying
from 25 to 80 lbs. Ladies' bows are from 25 to 40
lbs. in strength, and those of gentlemen from 50 to
80 lbs. One side of the bow is flat, called its
"back;" the other rounded, is called the "belly;"
and nearly in the middle, where the hand should
take the hold, it is lapped round with velvet, and
that part is called the "handle." In each of the
tips of horn is a notch for the string called "the
nock."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bowstrings</span> are made of hemp or flax, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
former being the better material; for though at
first they stretch more, yet they wear longer, and
stand a harder pull as well as being more elastic
in the shooting. In applying a fresh string to a
bow, be careful in opening it not to break the composition
that is on it; cut the tie, take hold of the
eye, which will be found ready-worked at one end,
let the other part hang down, and pass the eye
over the upper end of the bow. If for a lady, it
may be held from 2 to 2&frac12; inches below the nock;
if for a gentleman, half an inch lower, varying it
according to the length and strength of the bow;
then run your hand along the side of the bow and
string to the bottom nock, turn it round that and
fix it by the noose, called the "timber noose,"
taking care not to untwist the string in making it.
This noose is merely a simple turn back and twist
without a knot, but it is better seen than described.
When strung, a lady's bow will have the string
about 5 or 5&frac12; inches from the belly; and a gentleman's
about half an inch more. The part opposite
the handle, is bound round with waxed silk,
in order to prevent its being frayed by the arrow.
As soon as a string becomes too soft and the fibers
too straight, rub it with bees-wax, and give it a
few turns in the proper direction, so as to shorten
it and twist its strands a little tighter; a spare
string should always be provided by the shooter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Arrows</span> are differently shaped by the various
makers; some being of uniform thickness throughout,
while others are protuberant in the middle;
some, again, are larger at the point than at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
feather end, which I believe to be the best form for
shooting; and others are quite the reverse. They
are now invariably made of white deal, with points
of iron or brass riveted on, but generally having
a piece of heavy wood spliced on to the deal between
it and the point, by which their flight is improved.
At the other end a piece of horn is inserted,
in which is a notch for the string; and they
are armed with three feathers glued on, one of
which is of a different color to the others, and is
intended to mark the proper position of the arrow
when placed on the string&mdash;this one always pointing
from the bow. These feathers, properly applied,
give a rotary motion to the arrow which
causes its flight to be straight. They are generally
from the wing of the turkey or goose. The length and
weight vary; the latter being marked in sterling silver
coin, stamped on the arrow in plain figures. It is
usual to paint a crest, or a distinguishing ring or
rings, on the arrow just above the feathers, by
which they may be known in shooting at the target.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Quiver</span> is merely a tin case painted green,
and is intended for the security of the arrows when
not in use. The <span class="smcap">Pouch</span> and <span class="smcap">Belt</span> are worn round
the waist, and the latter contains those arrows
which are actually being shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Pot to Hold Grease for Touching the
Glove and String, and a Tassel</span> to wipe the
arrows, are hung to the belt. The grease is composed
of deer-suet, or of beef-suet, and bees-wax
melted together. Instead of a leather belt, ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
use a cord and tassels round the waist, to which
the pouch, of a different shape to that adopted by
gentlemen, is hooked; and this, again, has the
grease-pot suspended to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Arm</span> is protected from the blow of the
string by the brace, a broad guard of strong
leather buckled on by two straps. A <span class="smcap">Shooting-Glove</span>,
also of thin tubes of leather, is attached to
the wrist by three flat pieces ending in a circular
strap buckled round it. This glove prevents that
soreness of the fingers which soon comes on after
using the bow without it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Target</span> consists of a circular thick mat of
straw covered with canvas, painted in a series of
circles. It is usually from three feet six inches to
four feet in diameter; the middle is about six or
eight inches in diameter, gilt, and called "the
gold;" the next is called "the red," after which
comes the "inner white," then "the black," and
finally, "the outer white." These targets are
mounted upon triangular stands, at distances apart
of from 50 to 100 yards; 60 being the usual shooting
distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Scoring-Card</span> is provided with columns for
each color, which are marked with a pin, as here
indicated. The usual score for a gold hit, 9; the
red, 7; inner white, 6; black, 3, and outer white, 1.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Use of the Bow.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">To Bend and String the Bow</span> properly, the following
directions will be serviceable, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
young archer should pay particular attention to
them, since a neglect of these cautions will often
lead to a fracture of the bow by bending it the
wrong way:</p>

<p>Take the bow by the <i>handle</i>, in the <i>right</i> hand.</p>

<p>Place the bottom end upon the ground, resting
against the hollow of the inside of the right foot,
keeping the flat side of the bow (called the <i>back</i>) towards
your person; the left foot should be advanced
a little, and the right placed so that the bow cannot
slip sideways.</p>

<p>Place the heel of the left hand upon the upper
limb of the bow, below the eye of the string. Now,
while the fingers and thumb of the left hand slide
this eye towards the notch in the horn, and the
heel <i>pushes</i> the limb away from the body, the right
hand <i>pulls</i> the handle towards the person, and thus
resists the action of the left, by which the bow is
bent, and at the same time the string is slipped
into the "nock," as the notch is termed.</p>

<p>Take care to keep the three outer fingers free
from the string, for if the bow should slip from the
hand, and the string catch them, they will be
severely pinched. If shooting in frosty weather,
warm the bow before a fire, or by friction with a
woolen cloth. If the bow has been lying by for a
long time, it should be well rubbed with boiled
linseed oil before using.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Unstring the Bow</span>, hold it as in stringing;
then press down the upper limb exactly as before,
and as if you wished to place the eye of the string
in a higher notch; this will loosen the string and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
liberate the eye, when it must be lifted out of the
nock by the forefinger, and suffered to slip down the
limb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before Using the Bow</span>, hold it in a perpendicular
direction, with the string towards you, and
see if the line of the string cuts the middle of the
bow; if not, shift the eye and noose of the string
to either side, so as to make the two lines coincide.
This precaution prevents a very common cause of
defective shooting, which is the result of an uneven
string throwing the arrow on one side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After Using It</span>, unstring it; and if a large
party is shooting, after every end it should be liberated
from its state of tension; but in this respect
there is a great difference in different bows, some
good ones soon getting cast from their true shape,
and others, though inferior bows, bearing any ordinary
amount of tension without damage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The General Management of the Bow</span> should
be on the principle that damp injures it, and that
any loose floating ends interfere with its shooting.</p>

<p>It should, therefore, be kept well varnished,
and in a water-proof case, and it should be carefully
dried after shooting in damp weather. If
there are any ends hanging from the string cut
them off pretty close, and see that the whipping in
the middle of the string is close and well-fitting.
The case should be hung up against a dry internal
wall, not too near fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Selecting the Bow</span>, be careful that it is not
too strong for your power, and that you can draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the arrow to its head without any trembling of the
hand. If this cannot be done after a little practice,
the bow should be changed for a weaker one, for
no arrow will go true if it is discharged by a
trembling hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Selecting Arrows</span>, be careful that they are
not too long. For a bow of 5 feet 10 inches, the
arrows should be about 2 feet 4 inches in length.
For a lady's bow of 4 feet 10 inches, the arrow
should measure about 2 feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Shooting</span>, keep the longer limb of the bow
upwards, as the bow is liable to be broken if
used the other way, and the wrapping of the string
does not coincide with the upper part of the handle.
Bows may be broken either from the above
circumstance, or by overdrawing them, or by snapping
the string without an arrow in it, or by the
string breaking; and if a bow stands all these
trials, it is to be prized as a sound and good bit of
stuff.</p>

<p>After an arrow has been shot into the target or
the ground, be particularly careful to withdraw it,
by laying hold close to its head, and by twisting it
round as it is withdrawn in the direction of its
axis. Without this precaution it may be easily
bent or broken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Shooting at the Target</span>, the first thing to
be done is <span class="smcap">to Nock the Arrow</span>&mdash;that is, to place
it properly on the string. In order to effect this,
take the bow in the left hand, with the string towards
you, the upper limb being towards the right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Hold it horizontally while you take the arrow by
the middle, pass it on the <i>under</i> side of the string
and the <i>upper</i> side of the bow, till the head reaches
two or three inches past the left hand; hold it
there with the forefinger or thumb while you remove
the right hand down to the nock. Turn the
arrow till the cock-feather comes uppermost; then
pass it down the bow, and fix it on the nocking
point of the string. In doing this, all contact with
the feathers should be avoided, unless they are
rubbed out of place, when they may be smoothed
down by passing them through the hand from the
point towards the nock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Attitude</span> for shooting should be graceful as
well as serviceable. The body should be at right
angles with the target; but the face must be turned
over the left shoulder, so as to be opposed to it.
The feet are to be flat on the ground, with the
heels a little apart, the left foot turned towards the
mark; the head and chest inclined a <i>little</i> forward,
so as to present a full bust, but not bent at all below
the waist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Drawing the Bow</span>, proceed as follows:</p>

<p><i>1st Method.</i>&mdash;Take hold of the bow with the left
hand, having the elbow straight; then, having
placed the arrow as directed in the last paragraph,
and having the finger-stalls or shooting-glove on,
put a finger on each side of the arrow on the string
and the thumb on the opposite side, so as to steady
it; then raise all at the full length of the arm till
the right hand reaches nearly to the level of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
shoulder, and the left is opposite the target, when,
by drawing the one to the ear, and the other towards
the target, the arrow is brought to a direct
line with the bull's-eye, and at that moment it is
released.</p>

<p><i>2nd Method.</i>&mdash;Draw the arrow as before, but
pause when the arrow is fully extended to the head,
and take aim. This, however, requires a very
strong arm, and also a strong bow, or there will
be a quivering of the muscles, which is communicated
to the arrow; beside the danger of breaking
the bow. The loosing must be quick, and the string
must leave the fingers smartly and steadily, the
bow hand at that moment being held as firm as a
vise, upon which the goodness of the flight mainly
depends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Following Directions</span> should be attended
to strictly, if good shooting is to be attained:&mdash;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Fix the attention steadily upon the object,
and disregard all external objects, which are liable
otherwise to distract the eye at the moment of
shooting.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;In drawing the bow, in order to secure the
arrow in its place, turn the bow a little obliquely,
so that the handle and your knuckles will together
form a groove for the arrow to run in. When it
falls off, it is from the string being held too far up
by the fingers, which causes it to twist in the
drawing, and the arrow is thereby thrown off from
resting against the bow. The proper length is
midway between the ends and the first joint of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
fingers. Three fingers may be used, but the arrow
should be between the first and second.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;In taking aim, two points must be attended
to, viz: the <span class="smcap">lateral</span> <i>direction</i> and the <i>distance</i>, because
there is no bow which will drive an arrow
many yards perfectly <i>point-blank</i>, and, consequently,
a slight elevation must in all cases be made,
and for long distances, with weak bows, a very
considerable one. It requires great experience to
manage the elevation properly, and much must depend
upon the exact strength of the bow, and the
distance of the shot. With regard to the lateral
direction, it is materially affected by the wind, and
this must always be allowed for if there is any stirring;
and if it is in the line of the targets, one end
will require much less elevation than the other.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Fix the eyes on the mark, and not on the
arrow. Avoid all such expedients as putting a
mark on the glove to aim by. Do not look from
the mark to the arrow and back again. The
proper plan is to keep both eyes open, and look
steadily at the mark, while with the hands the bow
is raised or lowered in accordance with what the
<i>mind thinks</i> is the proper direction.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;If an arrow falls off the string, and the
archer can reach it with his bow, it is not shot:
but if he cannot, it must be counted as such.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<h3>TARGET-SHOOTING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Targets</span> are fixed exactly opposite each
other, at 60 yards or perhaps more apart. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
stands, when properly placed, are each called "an
end." The proper number of arrows, as fixed by
the rules, are then shot from each end by all the
party assembled, when all proceed to pick up or
extract their arrows, the marker scoring for each
before drawing them from the target, after which
the party shoot back again to the other end, and
so on until the whole number of ends have been
shot.</p>


<hr class="r5" />

<h3>BUTT-SHOOTING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Butts</span> are built of long sods of turf pressed together.
The form of the base is an oblong square,
being about 8 or 9 feet on the front side, and 5 feet
wide at the ends. The height is generally about 7
feet, and the depth diminishes gradually from the
bottom to the top. When more than two are
wanted they are ranged in sets; each set consists
of four, ranged at the distance of 30 yards apart,
and forming a chain of lengths of 30, 60, 90, and
120 yards; but so disposed as not to stand in the
way of the archers when shooting at any of the
lengths. Against the front of the butt is placed the
mark, which is a circular piece of thin white pasteboard,
fastened by a peg through the middle. The
size of this, for 30 yards, is four inches in diameter;
for 60 yards, 8 inches; and so on increasing
in diameter in proportion to the distance. Shots
in the butt missing the mark are not scored; and
he who makes the greatest number of hits is the
winner. If two are alike, the nearest to the central
peg is the successful one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roving.</span></h3>

<p>This is so called because the archers rove from
place to place, and have no fixed target, but shoot
at trees or any other object which presents itself.
The winner of the first shot chooses the next, and
so on; the distance being from 100 to 200 yards;
and all arrows falling within five bow-lengths
scoring, if nearer to the mark than the adversary's
arrow.</p>


<hr class="r5" />

<h3><span class="smcap">Flight-Shooting.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Flight-Shooting</span> is merely a trial of distance,
and he who can shoot the furthest is the winner of
the trial.</p>


<hr class="r5" />

<h3><span class="smcap">Clout-Shooting.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clout</span> is a small white target of pasteboard,
about twelve inches in diameter, which is slipped
into a cleft stick, and this is stuck into the ground
obliquely, so as to bring the lower edge of the clout
to the ground. The distance is generally from 8 to
10 score-yards, and the same rules apply as in
roving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cross-bow Shooting.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cross-bows</span> are bows set in a frame which receives
the arrow or bolt, and they are set and discharged
by a trigger after taking aim. They are,
however, now seldom used except for rook-shooting;
and even there the pea-rifle has almost entirely
superseded them.</p>

<h3>RULES OF ARCHERY MEETINGS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rules</span> by which archery meetings are governed
are partly the same as in all other similar
societies, and partly peculiar to this craft. The
former consist of those which regulate the election
of members, providing for refreshments, &amp;c.,
which vary according to circumstances, and need
not here be specified. The latter are generally as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;That a "lady paramount" be annually elected.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;That there be &mdash; meetings in each year, the
gentleman at whose house the meeting takes place
to be president; and that every member intending
to shoot should be on the ground by &mdash; o'clock.
The shooting to commence at &mdash; and to terminate
at &mdash;.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;That all members intending to shoot shall
appear in the uniform of the club; and that a silver
badge be worn by every member of the society, or
a forfeit will be enforced for such omission.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;That the secretary do send out cards at
least a month before each day of meeting, acquainting
the members with the day and place of
meeting.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;That there shall be four prizes at each meeting,
two for each sex; the first for numbers, the
second for hits, and that no person shall be allowed
to have both on the same day. The sum
of &mdash;&mdash; dollars to be placed at the disposal of the
"lady paramount" for prizes at each meeting.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;That the winner of a prize, or prizes, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
lose a ring for each prize won. But that a ring be
given back after any subsequent meeting at which
such member shall shoot without winning.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;That in case of a tie for hits, numbers shall
decide; and in case of a tie for numbers, hits shall
decide.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;That the decision of the "lady paramount"
shall be final.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;Two prizes to be given at each meeting for
strangers, of the value of &mdash;.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;That there be a challenge prize of the value
of &mdash;, and that a commemorative silver ornament
be presented to winners of the challenge prize, to
which a clasp be added on future occasions.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;That the distance for shooting be 60 and
100 yards, and that 4-feet targets be used.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;That each shooter be allowed to shoot &mdash; arrows,
distinctly marked or colored.</p>


<hr class="r5" />

<h3>DRESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Usual Dress for Ladies</span> peculiar to archery
is in most cases a green jacket worn over
white; sometimes, however, the color is black.</p>

<p>The gentlemen's costume is not generally fixed in
archery clubs, but sometimes a green suit is the
club uniform.</p>


<hr class="r5" />

<h3>EXPENSES.</h3>

<p>The expenses of archery are not usually great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
though a good many arrows will be lost or spoiled
during a season's shooting, especially if the grass
is not kept mown very close. Bows and all the
other paraphernalia last a long while; and, with
the exception of the arrows, the first cost may be
considered to be the only one, over and above the
subscription to the club, to which most archers
like to belong, competition being the essence of the
sport.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="HURDLE_RACING" id="HURDLE_RACING">HURDLE RACING.</a></h2>

<p>1. The usual distance, 120 yards, over ten hurdles,
regulation height, three feet six inches upright,
not less than 12 or more than 20 feet apart,
first hurdle must be placed 15 yards from the
scratch-mark.</p>

<p>2. Hurdles must be cleared with a jump, touching
the hands to the hurdle will be declared foul,
and the offender disqualified.</p>

<p>3. Hurdle races may be arranged for any distance
and any height of hurdle.</p>

<p>4. Each contestant must keep in his direct line
of starting, or as near so as circumstances will
permit. Any deviation from such line will subject
the offender to disqualification.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;There are three requisites to make a
good hurdler: Speed, spring, and judgment; speed
to cover the ground, spring to jump the hurdles,
and judgment to measure the steps between the
hurdles. It is one of the many healthful exercises in
Athletics, but requires much practice and experience;
beginners should make their first effort at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
two feet six inches. Great care must be taken not
to touch the top bar, as it virtually throws you out
of the race and may cause injury.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="VAULTING_WITH_POLE_OR_POLE-LEAPING" id="VAULTING_WITH_POLE_OR_POLE-LEAPING">VAULTING WITH POLE, OR POLE-LEAPING.</a></h2>

<p>1. The uprights should be nine feet apart, and
the bar placed on pins projecting two inches.</p>

<p>2. The pole must fall so as not to touch the
bar.</p>

<p>3. A competitor touching the bar without causing
it to fall shall be considered to have cleared it.</p>

<p>4. The height of bar at starting shall be determined
by a majority of the contestants.</p>

<p>5. Competitors will be allowed three trials at
each height.</p>

<p>6. The bar shall be raised at the discretion of a
majority of the contestants, and so continued until
only one competitor vaults over it, who shall be
declared the victor.</p>

<p>7. When a competitor knocks the bar down, the
rotation rule must be enforced, as in the running
high jump.</p>

<p>8. Three balks shall be called "no vault," and
must be recorded as one of the three trials.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This graceful and manly exercise has of
late years been greatly abused, not so much for
want of rules, as it was and is to have these rules
enforced. We have seen two men, at three different
meetings, claim the right to the grounds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
time of at least one of the judges for from two to
three hours, whereas, had the rules been strictly
enforced, one would have gained a victory or both
been disqualified. Gentlemen Judges, please remember
these contestants appear before an audience
(who pay admission) to perform, not to practice,
and when they insist upon keeping the bar at
a height that delays the games, they should be
disqualified under the rules.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="THROWING_THE_HAMMER" id="THROWING_THE_HAMMER">THROWING THE HAMMER.</a></h2>

<p>1. The hammer-head shall be of solid iron, perfectly
round, standard weights, 16 and 12 pounds,
exclusive of handle. Length of handle three feet
six inches over all. The handle should be made
from split <i>white hickory wood</i>.</p>

<p>2. The competitor must stand at the scratch
with one foot touching the scratch-mark. He is
at liberty to throw with one or both hands.</p>

<p>3. Touching the ground, over the scratch-mark,
with any portion of the body before the
hammer strikes, shall be declared "no throw,"
and must be recorded as one of the three trials.</p>

<p>4. Permitting the hammer to carry a competitor
from his balance or letting the hammer go out of
time must stand as one of the three trials.</p>

<p>5. When the head and handle strike the ground
at the same time the head or iron is the measuring
mark, at the first break of the ground made by
it. Should the handle strike first, one length of
the handle, in a direct line with the throw, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
added. The measurement must be from the
scratch-mark, midway between the thrower's feet,
to the first break, in accordance with above rules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In soft or clay bottom there is no difficulty
in getting accurate measurement, but in quick
or shifting sand close attention is required.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="PUTTING_THE_SHOT" id="PUTTING_THE_SHOT">PUTTING THE SHOT.</a></h2>

<p>1. The shot must be of solid iron and perfectly
round, standard weight 16 pounds. The shot
must be put from the shoulder with one hand, not
thrown from the side or under swing.</p>

<p>2. Competitors will take their position between
two parallel lines, said lines being seven feet apart.
Passing the toe-mark, or touching the ground outside
of the mark, with any part of the body before
the shot strikes the ground, will be judged and recorded
a foul, "no put," and must stand as one of
the three trials.</p>

<p>3. Each competitor is entitled to three trials.
The measurement shall be from the scratch-line or
mark opposite the toe-print to the first or nearest
break of the ground made by the shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The object being to see how many feet
and inches the competitors can put, in accordance
with the above rules, not how straight they can
put.</p>
